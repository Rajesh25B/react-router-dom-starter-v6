**Dynamic URL mapping:

This folder mainly about getting params from the url
for ex: "localhost:3000/users/1" to grab 1 from above url and pass it inside of a component.

    <Route path='users/' element={<Users />}>
      <Route path=':userId' element={<Users />}/>
    </Route>

":userId" is a dynamic, anything that comes after /users/
we can grab that using a hook called useParams() from react-router-dom.

const userId = useParams()

pass it in JSX as {userId} and view on webpage that shows whatever
in the url.
